To check if the Cronjob is running as per the required schedule, you can use the kubectl get cronjob command to see the status of the Cronjob. Run the following command:
    - kubectl get cronjob orange-cron-cka10-trb
    This will show you the current status of the Cronjob, including the last time it was run and any errors that may have occurred.

To fix the Cronjob, you can edit it using the kubectl edit cronjob command. Run the following command:
    - kubectl edit cronjob orange-cron-cka10-trb
    This will open the Cronjob configuration in your default editor. Look for the spec.schedule field and 
    make sure it is set to */2 * * * *, which will run the Cronjob every two minutes.

To check if the application is accessible, you can use the kubectl port-forward command to forward traffic 
from your local machine to the ClusterIP service running inside the orange-app-cka10-trb pod. Run the following command:
    - kubectl port-forward svc/orange-app-cka10-trb 8080:80
    This will forward traffic from port 8080 on your local machine to port 80 on the service. You can then open a web browser and 
    go to http://localhost:8080 to access the application. If the application is accessible, you should see the expected content.

To look for completed Cron jobs, you can use the kubectl get jobs command to see a list of all completed jobs. 
Run the following command:
    - kubectl get jobs
    This will show you a list of all completed jobs, including any Cron jobs that have finished running. 
    You can use this to check if the Cron job is running successfully and completing as expected.
